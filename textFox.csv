""that’s probably something most people don’t realize,"" knapp explained. ""it’s in every professional sport for the most part, but the difference is when you’re in minor league baseball or some of these small organizations, or the farm systems, you’re still a part of an organization, so i’m assuming they help you somewhat financially. in golf, you’re 100% on your own.""knapp's smooth tempo in his golf swing has captivated fans, as he effortlessly averages 306.1 yards per drive this season, which is 22nd on tour. a ""no-brainer"" move to use parsons xtreme golf (pxg) irons and wedges also gives him the right control to make sure he's scoring to keep himself in contention during these tournaments. ""i mainly play one wedge and the irons, and the irons were kinda the decision maker for me in who i was going to go with,"" knapp said about working with pxg clubs. ""as soon as i did testing with them, it was a no-brainer for me. they fit my eye and they have the look of a blade and the forgiveness of a cavity back. so, it’s the perfect mix for me.""knapp has been able to use those clubs on the augusta national course already, making trips prior to the masters to get himself acclimated with the course – one he feels his game can work well on. jake knapp hits a tee shot during the second round of the texas children's houston open at memorial park golf course on march 29, 2024.

financial managementas someone who processes debit fraud claims daily, and luckily has never experienced it herself, below are the top do’s and don’ts of debit card use.1) safest way to use your debit card: use your debit card to withdraw money from your own financial institution’s atm or teller. preferably transfer larger amounts of money out of a checking account into high-yield savings accounts so that your money isn’t readily available in large sums in a checking account.safest way to use your debit card:2) why credit cards are generally better for purchases: don't use your debit card to make regular or frequent purchases. it is better to use a regular credit card for those transactions. it leaves you less exposed to potential debit card fraud. if a scammer gets a hold of your credit card, it is easier to freeze that card, cancel it or get a new one issued. if your debit card or debit card number gets compromised, you could lose all your cash in your checking account.why credit cards are generally better for purchases:person using phone to make purchase (kurt ""cyberguy"" knutsson)person using phone to make purchase (kurt ""cyberguy"" knutsson)person using phone to make

convenience and security: if you must use your debit card to make regular purchases, add it to your smartphone wallet (like apple pay or google pay) and use it that way instead of swiping your debit card. not being swiped likely prevents your card from being skimmed. consider using mobile wallets for convenience and security:skimmedskimmed4) protecting your pin is crucial: do not write your pin down on your card or a piece of paper in your wallet.protecting your pin is crucial:5) recurring payments aren't affected by locking your card: even if you have recurring payments for bills such as utilities, they usually can still be made if your debit card is locked. when a debit card is locked, single transactions aren’t allowed.recurring payments aren't affected by locking your card:6) don't share your debit card: your debit card is a legal agreement between you and your financial institution. letting anyone else use your card, even family, may jeopardize your ability to be compensated for fraudulent transactions. your child accidentally purchasing something with your debit card saved on your mobile app is not considered fraud.don't share your debit card:7) financial reimbursement might not be immediate: while some financial institutions will reimburse fraudulent transactions, they may not be fast enough to cover checks, e-checks or recurring financial transactions. you’d likely be at risk of incurring overdraft fees, non-sufficient funds or late charges from your financial institutions, creditors or merchants – all of which would be costly.financial reimbursement might not be immediate:8) enable alerts to catch fraudulent activity quickly: most financial institutions offer financial alerts or restrictions for all transactions on checking accounts and cards. use them so you can be notified of any fraudulent transactions immediately. the faster you can report these charges to your financial institution, the more likely you are to stop scammers in their tracks.enable alerts to catch fraudulent activity quickly:couple who learned about debit card fraud (kurt ""cyberguy"" knutsson)couple who learned about debit card fraud (kurt ""cyberguy""

federal judge has postponed trump's classified records trial indefinitely. it was supposed to start later this month, but like my vacation plans with kristi noem, that ain't happening. you remember that case: the sham trial stemming from the classified records investigation cooked up by jack smith. the trial should have started may 20, but due to the myriad and interconnected pretrial issues, judge aileen cannon put the whole damn thing on hold. translation: that case is imploding faster than when my butt implants went scuba diving. classified records investigationand our instincts as to why are correct. the judge's decision to postpone the trial comes just days after jack smith's own prosecutors admitted that evidence was rearranged after the fbi's raid on mar-a-lago back in august

""he’s already a lame duck. if we have the vote today in our conference, he would not be speaker today.""yet greene didn’t call the vote on johnson. that maneuver might have been extraordinary, especially considering that the house took the unprecedented step of stripping former house speaker kevin mccarthy, r-calif., of the gavel last fall.so, why didn’t greene move?rep. marjorie taylor greene speaks to the media after the house of representatives passed bills for aid to ukraine and israel on april 20, 2024.

security tool has allowed the united states to counter our adversaries like china and russia and thwarted numerous terrorist attacks from isis and al qaeda. house intelligence committee chairman mike

committee chairman mike turner(ap)under the leadership of chairman mike turner, r-ohio, the house of representatives has spent over a year crafting reforms to fisa that will prevent potential future abuses or inappropriate actions from the intelligence community while maintaining section 702’s ability to monitor foreign terrorists and spies overseas.fbi improperly used warrantless search powers

powers more than 278,000 times in 2021, fisa court filing revealsthis legislation directly addresses fisa abuses by reducing the number of fbi personnel who can authorize a u.s. person query by more than 90%. furthermore, it statutorily ties fbi leadership’s querying compliance directly to their compensation and assesses escalating penalties for an fbi agent’s subsequent abuses.directly addresses fisa abusesvideovideovideovideovideoto prevent future abuse, the committee’s reforms would prohibit using political opposition research and media reports to secure a fisa order, as well as create five enhanced criminal penalties for those who violate fisa, leak fisa applications, or lie to the fisa court. finally, these reforms would open up the fisa court by requiring proceedings to be transcribed and made available to congressional oversight while assigning a court-appointed counsel to scrutinize u.s. person surveillance applications.the continuation of fisa, bolstered by essential reforms to further protect american civil liberties from cases of misuse and exploitation, is pivotal in securing our country against existing and emerging threats while upholding the core principles of our

""i never envisioned myself as the guy who would have a ""letter to basketball"" retirement announcement…and i’m still not going to be that guy,"" he began his statement. ""but as i reflected on my career, the one feeling i kept coming back to and the one thing i wanted to express was thankfulness.""i’m thankful for every single moment – not just the good ones: the wins, the awards, the dunks, and the memorable times spent with family, friends, fans, teammates, and coaches. i could continue on about the people in my life who have contributed immensely to my career, but in this short non-letter, i have to acknowledge my parents, tommy and gail, and my brother, taylor, for their unconditional support and guidance. lastly, my agent sam goldfeder, who has been a steadfast voice of reason and my wartime consigliere – thank you.""griffin, known for his highlight-reel dunks since his college days at oklahoma, brought the thunder down on many opponents over the years, earning him star status in the league. one of his most famous dunks came against the new york knicks, soaring over center timofey mozgov and putting him on a poster. griffin’s vertical leaping abilities were seen at all times, including this dunk as he came off a screen and jumped off two feet outside the paint. and griffin never even made contact with the rim, just throwing the ball right in. new york knickswhile his dunking abilities got the crowds roaring over the years, he was a tremendous scorer during his five-year stretch with the clippers from 2010 to 2015, when he averaged 21.5 points per game with 9.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists.griffin played eight seasons with the clippers before he was traded to the detroit pistons during the 2017-2018 campaign. he would earn his sixth and final all-star bid the next season, averaging a career-high 24.5 points per game with 7.5 rebounds and 5.4 assists.blake griffin's dunking abilities got the crowds roaring over the years.

""i am equally thankful for the not-so-good moments: the losses, the injuries, the wayyyy too many surgeries, the lessons, the heartbreaks, and it wouldn’t be sports retirement letter without acknowledging the ‘haters.’ all of these experiences made my 14 years in the league truly unforgettable, and i can’t help but to just feel thankful,"" griffin’s statement continued.""the game of basketball has given me so much in this life, and i wouldn’t change a thing. last but certainly not least, here comes the obligatory ‘i’m excited for my next chapter’ part: just kidding, i’m done.""while griffin mentions 14 years in the league, his rookie season was a bummer as he suffered a knee injury that delayed his debut until the 2010-2011 season. blake griffin has announced his retirement from the nba.

(demetrius freeman/the washington post via getty images) no wonder so many lawsuits have been filed in just the last couple of weeks to challenge these new changes. women under biden administration’s

women who usually get hurt. when they try to share the same restrooms and locker rooms, it’s usually the women who get taken advantage of and preyed upon. video it’s the whole reason men have their

competition, the forced integration of male athletes who identify as female into their teams and events surely will. despite disingenuous claims by the biden administration that these new regulations won’t impact women’s athletics, it’s clear that they will, in fact, have a devastating effect. there’s just no way to redefine ""sex"" in the laws regulating sports without affecting sports. and, given that the administration has been saying for years that men must be welcomed into women’s athletics, it makes no sense that they won’t seize this chance to enforce that agenda. video the effects

(chip somodevilla/getty images)federal trade commission chair lina khan has sided with foreign regulators and discredited american tech companies.(chip somodevilla/getty images)furthermore, khan attempts to discredit american tech companies by claiming that large companies only ""deliver marginal innovations"" while breakthrough innovations more often come from outsiders. this is a gross departure from reality for two reasons. firstly, data shows that out of the top five companies in the world that spend the most on research and development, four of them are american tech companies that khan’s ftc has targeted. second, khan ignores the fact that tech leaders do not suppress innovation but instead help set and enforce safety and privacy standards for the entire digital ecosystem, which are critical for smaller firms to have a competitive chance. one such example is the app store model used by various tech companies which protects users from inadvertently downloading malicious malware onto their phones via third party apps. unsurprisingly, eager antitrust regulators have taken issue with these business practices as well, despite clear evidence that they have enabled smaller digital developers to thrive and give consumers more choices, and without them, private data and emerging software developers would face multiplying cyber threats. videovideovideovideovideofinally, khan has failed to credibly address any of the national security concerns regarding the ftc’s actions. instead, she has dismissed these concerns and suggested that the u.s. tech sector is not aligned with america’s geopolitical priorities, citing a red herring in which she claims enabling tech leaders would negatively impact supply chain resilience. certainly, the u.s. has supply chain vulnerabilities that should be addressed, but the nature of these challenges is profoundly different for the digital economy. khan fails to recognize this and the role of the u.s. sector in supporting u.s. national security goals, especially in terms of security risks related to competition with the people’s republic of china (prc). american tech companies such as google, facebook and amazon have taken the initiative to retreat from the prc. they have been doing so for more than a decade considering the u.s.-china relationship has become increasingly characterized by strategic rivalry. click here for more *** news opinionclick here for more *** news opinionclick here for more *** news opinionkhan’s comments also overlook silicon valley’s contributions to america’s geopolitical interests in europe. innovative tech firms like google, maxar technologies, palantir and scale ai have strongly supported ukraine in their fight against russian aggression. their contributions range from countering cyber offensives and documenting war crimes to debunking russian propaganda. over-regulation could stifle innovation and the ability of the u.s. tech sector to contribute to american global interests, therefore harming u.s. security. khan rightly recognizes innovation as the key factor that propels america’s economic competitiveness that must be protected. but innovation is not being trampled on by leading american businesses, it is being trampled on by khan’s ftc. khan rightly recognizes innovation as the key factor that propels america’s economic competitiveness that must be protected. but innovation is not being trampled on by leading american businesses, it is being trampled on by khan’s ftc. under khan, the ftc is also positioning itself to be the chief regulator of artificial intelligence (ai), overstepping the scope of its regulatory authority. ai will be a force multiplier and key driver of both economic and national security. it is also a critical domain for the strategic competition with china that beijing has prioritized to exploit. chief regulator of artificial intelligence (ai),click here to get the *** news appclick here to get the *** news appclick here to get the *** news appthe ftc actions demonstrate a lack of understanding about the national security implications of over-regulating ai. without national security competencies, the ftc’s regulatory approach to ai will likely harm u.s. ai providers, thereby allowing the prc to catch up or, even worse, overtake the u.s. in the ai race. this would be detrimental to industries and economic sectors far beyond the tech innovation space and would put wider u.s. economic and national power at risk. the ftc is supposed to be a force that ensures a fair, competitive and innovative market that protects consumers and america’s interests. under chairwoman khan, the ftc has taken its authority to an extreme and focused its efforts on imposing interventionist government regulations without regard to the consequences to u.s. economic and national security. these policies are hamstringing tech innovation, eroding u.s. economic leadership and subverting america’s geopolitical interests. brian cavanaugh is a senior vice president with american global strategies llc. he recently served as special assistant to the president and senior director for resilience on the national

""tiktok has been decimating both facebook and google’s profits for years and has cut significantly into their market share. there’s nothing big tech would like more than to knock off their biggest competitor,"" mcentee told *** news digital. *** news digitalmcentee asked in the rhetorical style he often uses to make points in his viral videos, ""if republicans were serious about taking on big tech, why are they doing exactly what mark zuckerberg wants?"" indeed, a ban on tiktok appears to be exactly what zuckerberg wants. as the wall street journal wrote in 2020, meta founder and ceo mark zuckerberg has long implemented a ""copy, acquire, and kill"" strategy to defeat rival platforms. the 4-year-old article, which was published as meta geared up to launch instagram reels, noted that the product was designed to directly ""take on tiktok."" wrote in 2020while instagram reels has been a success, it hasn’t exactly slowed down tiktok, which remains the preferred social media platform for most young people. zuckerberg, who learned to speak mandarin and reportedly asked chinese president xi jinping to give his unborn baby an honorary chinese name in 2015, had long worked to make inroads with beijing. but zuckerberg’s messaging regarding china shifted, and the facebook founder began criticizing the chinese government as tiktok exploded in popularity. reportedly asked""china is building its own internet focused on very different values and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries. until recently, the internet in almost every country outside china has been defined by american platforms with strong free expression values. there’s no guarantee these values will win out,"" zuckerberg said during a 2019 speech at georgetown university before touting the meta-owned whatsapp and bashing tiktok. ""we’re beginning to see this in social media. while our services, like whatsapp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on tiktok, the chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the u.s.,"" he continued.

""zuckerberg censored legitimate news stories during the 2020 election and then banned the sitting president of the united states from his platform. so yes, him talking about tiktok being a ‘risk to american values’ seems a bit disingenuous,"" mcentee said. by 2022, the washington post reported that ""facebook quietly bankrolled small, grass-roots groups to fight its battles in washington,"" and noted that american edge was ""aggressively attacking rival tiktok for its ownership by china."" a separate 2022 washington post piece reported that meta paid gop consulting firm targeted victory to ""turn the public against tiktok.""former president trump disagrees with congress' efforts to ban tiktok in the u.s.

narrative that low-level drug offenders are filling up us prisons: expertsnew prison data blows up narrative that low-level drug offenders are filling up us prisons: expertsnew prison data blows up narrative that low-level drug offenders are filling up us prisons: expertsin short, it is evident that these non-sentencing factors can account for a majority of america's heightened incarceration rates compared to the 1960s, contradicting the mass incarceration narrative pushed by left-leaning researchers and commentators. furthermore, according to the professors, while certain punishments have indeed become more severe since the 1960s, most of these changes are likely viewed as aligning sentences more closely with what the community and many advocates for incarceration reform consider appropriate and just. this is particularly true in cases involving sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, human trafficking, firearm offenses and child pornography.child

in the united states. rather alarmingly, 100,000 of them are noncompliant and cannot be located.america's prison population is often compared to that of foreign countries, but this comparison fails to consider the various non-sentencing factors at play. for instance, it wrongly assumes that a high per capita incarceration rate in america always indicates a problem with american practices, rather than those of foreign nations. even blue states are learning bail reform is a disaster. red states re nexteven blue states are learning bail reform is a disaster. red states re nexteven blue states

incarceration rate isn’t necessarily safe, secure or more stable.mali and congovideovideovideovideovideoalthough the united states can undoubtedly gain insights from other nations, it is crucial to acknowledge that numerous foreign approaches to sentencing have resulted in significant discontent among citizens. in india, for example, people regularly take to the streets to protest against ridiculously lenient sentences for gang rapists (every 18 minutes, somewhere in india, a woman is raped). the debate over incarceration practices requires nuance, the paper’s authors suggest. concerningly, the legal experts believe that many myths surrounding mass incarceration have been intentionally created by those who oppose not only incarceration, but punishment in general. this is a very fair point. after all, in recent years, it has become fashionable to ask if prisons should be abolished entirely?prisons should be abolishedvideovideovideovideovideodemocrats want you to think

""soft tissue swelling, or edema, is not always a cause for concern, and can occur with weather changes or fluid shifts in the body,"" said amy kehl, m.d., rhmsus, a board-certified rheumatologist with saint john's physician partners in santa monica, california. fluid shifts can occur with too much salt intake — which can lead to increased hand or foot swelling, experts say. (getty images) most patients observe some degree of soft tissue swelling or edema with hot weather and with exercise, according to kehl. fluid shifts can also occur with too much salt intake, she noted, which can lead to increased hand or foot swelling, she said. ""certain medications can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet.""

""biden is the only president not to sit down with the editorial boards of the new york times, washington post, or wall street journal in his first term. he's held just three press conferences in the past 16 months. for context, donald trump held 35 solo press conferences during his final year in office,"" concha told *** news digital.""i'm willing to bet right now that joe biden will continue to do interviews with the howard sterns and jason batemans of the world, but won't go near any interview with anyone resembling a serious journalist, asking serious questions and follow-up questions before election day,"" concha continued.

""kappa’s directors have a simple duty. they must respect the clear terms of kappa’s bylaws. they utterly failed to do so by ending the sorority’s women-only membership and threatening existing members to accept the unlawful change or else lose their own membership,"" the sorority sisters' attorney, may mailman, said, according to a preview of oral arguments. ""if this fight were about any other common term, the violation would be obvious. gender ideology is not a reason to upend simple legal principles."" mailman told the judges tuesday the national sorority council was unfair to sorority members by changing who could belong. she argued that by allowing transgender women into the chapter at the university, the national sorority council and president violated their obligation to sorority members to faithfully follow sorority bylaws. kkg attorney natalie mclaughlin argued that state law in ohio, where the organization is based, gives wide leeway to define terms in those bylaws, including who is a woman. the appellate judges questioned whether they could even rule on the sorority members' appeal or if the lower court should continue to hear the case. the district judge dismissed the case without prejudice last year in a ruling that suggested the lawsuit could be refiled in his court. this, some of the judges suggested, could affect the ability to appeal. ""it seems to me it’s not final,"" appellate judge carolyn mchugh told mailman, according to cowboy state daily. mailman argued that the district court's decision gave enough justification for an appeal, but judge richard federico appeared to agree with mchugh. langford was accused of peeping behavior in a lawsuit which was later dismissed. (photo illustration) (msnbc/screenshot | adobe stock) after the hearing, gaines along with other members of the independent women's forum (iwf) held a ""save sisterhood"" press conference to discuss the lawsuit and call for the sorority and university to recognize women's rights. ""today during oral arguments, kappa said that they could not define what a ‘woman’ is, that this is a word that doesn’t have just one singular definition, and there are multiple definitions. they said there wasn’t enough research to be able to fully answer that question accurately,"" gaines said. ""but independent women’s forum is here on the ground as one of the leading women’s organizations fighting for the sanctity of truth, fighting for and defending women’s rights. we are standing for privacy, for safety, and equal opportunity. we are standing for women. the stand that we are taking is pro-woman, not anti-anyone or anything,"" gaines added. former members of the kkg sorority initially sued the national organization in march 2023. dylan mulvaney mocks bud light controversy while criticizing ‘transphobia and hate’ at awards speech kappa kappa gamma sorority members have appeared on *** news.

""if this fight were about any other common term, the violation would be obvious. gender ideology is not a reason to upend simple legal principles.""said,mailman told the judges tuesday the national sorority council was unfair to sorority members by changing who could belong. she argued that by allowing transgender women into the chapter at the university, the national sorority council and president violated their obligation to sorority members to faithfully follow sorority bylaws. kkg attorney natalie mclaughlin argued that state law in ohio, where the organization is based, gives wide leeway to define terms in those bylaws, including who is a woman.the appellate judges questioned whether they could even rule on the sorority members' appeal or if the lower court should continue to hear the case.the district judge dismissed the case without prejudice last year in a ruling that suggested the lawsuit could be refiled in his court. this, some of the judges suggested, could affect the ability to appeal.""it seems to me it’s not final,"" appellate judge carolyn mchugh told mailman, according to cowboy state daily.cowboy state dailymailman argued that the district court's decision gave enough justification for an appeal, but judge richard federico appeared to agree with mchugh.langford was accused of peeping behavior in a lawsuit which was later dismissed.
